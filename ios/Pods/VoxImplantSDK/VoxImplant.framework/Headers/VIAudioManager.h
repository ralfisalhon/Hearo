 * * In case if Bluetooth headset is connected, audio routing depends on where a call is answered (from bluetooth headset or from phone screen).
 *   Bluetooth headset will be activated only in case if a call is answered via Bluetooth headset controls. In other case the audio will be played via Receiver.
 *
 * * Audio is always routed to Bluetooth headset only in case if user selects "Bluetooth headset" as Call Audio Routing in the phone preferences.
 *
 * * In case if audio device is selected before CallKit activates the audio session, it is required to reselect this audio device after [[CXProviderDelegate provider:didActivateAudioSession:]](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/1833281-provider?language=objc) is called.

 * Otherwise audio routing may be reset to default.
